        This information is visualizations from the ProPublica release of Police
        Officer CCRB Records. [LINK]

      <p>
        These are all of the officers in the CCRB database that have complaints
        against them. The data is from 1985 through 2019, with 4 complaints from
        2020. Use the nav bar to see this information visualized in various
        ways. It's difficult to digest what these things mean, so it is my hope
        that illustrating in several different ways can help inform the reader
        in what this information actually represents. Mostly that, tax payers
        are paying police officers to intimidate through violence and threat of
        death instead of serving communities.
